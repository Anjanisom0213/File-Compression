# 📦 File Compression Tool

A simple GUI-based file compression and decompression tool using **Huffman Encoding**, developed in **Java** with **Swing** for the user interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔧 Compress and decompress text files using Huffman encoding algorithm
- 🖥️ User-friendly interface built with Java Swing
- 💾 File chooser for selecting files
- 🛠️ Basic error handling (invalid files, file not found, etc.)
- 📂 Output saved in the same directory with `.compressed` or `.decompressed` suffix

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- **Data Structures:** Priority Queue, HashMap, Tree
- **Algorithms:** Huffman Tree Construction, Tree Traversal, Bit Manipulation
- **Core Java Concepts:** File I/O, Exception Handling, GUI Programming with Swing

 ┣ 📄 AppFrame.java          # Main GUI interface
 ┣ 📄 Compressor.java        # Compression logic using Huffman encoding
 ┣ 📄 Decompressor.java      # Decompression logic
 ┗ 📄 README.md              # Project description

## 🛡️ Limitations
Currently supports only text files (.txt)

No drag-and-drop or multiple file selection (planned in future versions)

## 💡 Future Enhancements
 - Modern UI with JavaFX or flat design

 - Show compression statistics (file size before/after)

 - Drag and drop file support

 - Batch compression
